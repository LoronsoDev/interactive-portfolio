# Three JS interactive portfolio

This interactive portfolio is a twin of my irl room, with a physics based car that you can control using rapier based physics.

If you want to check out how to create rapier based cars, or just how to use rapier in React, you can check the simplified version in the branch <a href="https://github.com/LoronsoDev/interactive-portfolio/tree/car-physics-rapierjs">car-physics-rapierjs</a>, which is stripped down of the code that isn't strictly related to the physics-based car.

This is a very useful example of how to properly use React Three Fiber & Drei, as well as the rapier physics engine and its raycast based vehicles with React, since there isn't almost any information out there.

You can check my live portfolio at https://loronsodev.github.io/interactive-portfolio/, which is running directly from the code hosted in the master branch in this repo.

Have fun :)
