# Three JS interactive portfolio

This interactive portfolio is a twin of my irl room, with a physics based car that you can control using rapier based physics.

If you want to check out how to create rapier based cars, or just how to use rapier in React, you can check the simplified version in the branch <a href="https://github.com/LoronsoDev/interactive-portfolio/tree/car-physics-rapierjs">car-physics-rapierjs</a>.

This is a very useful example of how to properly use three js along with some of its most usual tools, as well as the rapier physics engine and its raycast based vehicles with React, since there isn't almost any information out there.
