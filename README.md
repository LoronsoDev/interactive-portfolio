# Three JS interactive portfolio

This interactive portfolio is a twin of my irl room, with a physics based car that you can control using rapier based physics.

If you want to check out how to create rapier based cars, or just how to use rapier in React, you can check the simplified version in the branch <a href="https://github.com/LoronsoDev/interactive-portfolio/tree/car-physics-rapierjs">car-physics-rapierjs</a>.

This is a very useful example of how to properly use three js as well as some of its most usual tools and the rapier physics engine with React.
